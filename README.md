# BikeSharing_ResearchProject

# Project Abstract

PyCaret is a machine learning library that enables and simplifies the process of model training and evaluation. Using the Bike Sharing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, this project aims to predict the hourly count of rented bikes by developing a regression model that can accurately predict the target value with help from the dataset's input features such as season, holiday, weekday, workingday, weather etc. It will further evaluate models such as CatBoost, LightGBM, Linear Regression, Random Forest etc and choose the best performing model.
